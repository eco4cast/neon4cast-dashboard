The most recent forecast for which we would now have observations to compare against the full 35 day forecast horizon would thus be the one made 35 days before this. Thus the NEON latency and the forecast horizon mean that the most recent fully scored forecast will tend to be one made somewhere between 1 and 2 months ago:\nLets access that forecast from the NOAA snapshots.\n\nTemperatureRH"
