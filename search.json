Keep in mind these are not the usual NOAA forecasts you see in daily life, GEFS are: 31 ensemble models at 1.0 degree lat/long squares resolution that extend a full 30 days in the future.

We obtain the date for the most recent observation (typically, the last day of the previous month.) The most recent forecast for which we would now have observations to compare against the full 35 day forecast horizon would thus be the one made 35 days before this. Thus the NEON latency and the forecast horizon mean that the most recent fully scored forecast will tend to be one made somewhere between 1 and 2 months ago:\n\n\n[1] \"2023-01-25\"\n\n\nLets access that forecast from the NOAA snapshots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperatureRH"
